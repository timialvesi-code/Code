This contract is a brief, unique, and winning Clarity solution for fair bidding on Google Clarity Web3. It allows owners to create Requests for Proposal (RFPs), vendors to securely commit proposals with a hash, later reveal them with a salt for transparency, and finally have the owner finalize and record the winner immutably on-chain. In under 25 lines, it delivers fairness, trust, and lightweight efficiency, making it ideal for real-world Web3 contract awards.
